//! The determinism harness: run a scripted scene twice, prove it agreed.
//!
//! This is the test that matters more than the rest. ADR-0002's fixed Sim Tick
//! and ADR-0007's integrator were both bought to make the same Level plus the
//! same inputs produce the same sequence of [`Snapshot`]s, and without a harness
//! asserting it the whole suite is measuring a moving target.
//!
//! Every later ticket extends this rather than writing its own: the Tongue, the
//! Gesture tracker, Slam, and the Combo each arrive as a [`Script`] run through
//! [`assert_deterministic`].
//!
//! Gated behind `test-util`, like `Level::from_ascii`, so nothing here can reach
//! a build that ships.
